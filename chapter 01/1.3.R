# decide what needs to be forecast ex: 
#     every product line or groups of products
#     every sales outlet, or outlets grouped by region or total sales only
#     weekly, monthly or yearly
#     what horizon!!! the model changes when the horizon changes
#     how frequently should you forecast? determines if automation needed
      
# talk with the people who will be using the forecast. What do they need? 
# what data is needed? internal and external(population, commercial
# construction rates, unemployment rates?)
